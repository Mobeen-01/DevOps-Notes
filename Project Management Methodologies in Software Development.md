# **Project Management Methodologies in Software Development**

1. Waterfall:
In the software development life cycle (SDLC) waterfall model, each set or stage of tasks should be finished before the next stage can begin. In waterfall project development, this is done to keep the project stages from overlapping.

  The waterfall approach got its name because it’s specifically designed to flow in one direction (downwards) just like a waterfall.  Its stages include analysis, initiation, testing, design, construction, deployment, maintenance, and testing.

 Also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model, the waterfall model was the first Process Model that was introduced. 
 
It requires much time to deliver project.
 
2. Agile:

In project management, agile methodology is defined as a process by which a team breaks up a particular project into multiple stages. This methodology also involves constant collaboration with major stakeholders and constant iteration and improvement at each stage. The agile methodology starts with clients discussing the purpose of the end product and what kind of problem it will solve. Through this, the customer's expectations of the team handling the project is made clear.

Each smaller task is passed through the 4 phases i-e plan, design, build, test.

# 3. Scrum
Scrum is a subset of the agile approach. It is a framework used for project management that prioritizes accountability, teamwork, and iterative progress in order to achieve a clear goal. The scrum method is based on a simple premise: begin with what is easily seen or known. Once you’ve done that, you can then start tracking progress and making changes as needed.

There are three pillars to remember when using the scrum framework: adaptation, inspection, and transparency.


  - **Framework within Agile:** Scrum is a specific framework within the Agile methodology. It defines roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Team), events (Sprint, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective), and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment).
  - **Time-Boxed Iterations:** Work is organized into time-boxed iterations called Sprints, usually 2-4 weeks long. At the end of each Sprint, a potentially shippable product increment is delivered.
  - **Regular Inspection and Adaptation:** Regularly inspect and adapt processes through Sprint Retrospectives for continuous improvement.
  - **Example:** In a Scrum project, a software development team plans a two-week Sprint to deliver a specific set of features. The team holds daily stand-up meetings, where they discuss progress and any impediments. At the end of the Sprint, a review is conducted with stakeholders to gather feedback, and the team reflects on their performance in the Sprint Retrospective.

In summary, Waterfall is a traditional, linear approach; Agile is a flexible and adaptive philosophy, and Scrum is a specific Agile framework with defined roles and ceremonies. The choice between them depends on the project's requirements, team dynamics, and the level of flexibility needed in response to changing conditions.
